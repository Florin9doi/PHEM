ID=kStr_OpError
ENGLISH=Could not %operation because %reason.

ID=kStr_OpErrorRecover
ENGLISH=Could not %operation because %reason. %recovery.


// Hardware Exceptions

ID=kStr_ErrBusError
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, causing a bus error.\n\nA “bus error” means that the application accessed a memory location that is not in RAM or ROM, nor corresponds to a memory-mapped hardware register.

ID=kStr_ErrAddressError
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, causing an address error.\n\nAn “address error” means that the application accessed a 2- or 4-byte value at an odd (i.e., not even) memory address.

ID=kStr_ErrIllegalInstruction
ENGLISH=%App just executed an illegal or unknown machine language instruction. The opcode executed was %ins.

ID=kStr_ErrDivideByZero
ENGLISH=%App just divided an integer by zero.

ID=kStr_ErrCHKInstruction
ENGLISH=%App just executed a CHK machine language instruction that failed. Invoking this instruction is not supported in Palm OS applications.

ID=kStr_ErrTRAPVInstruction
ENGLISH=%App just executed a TRAPV machine language instruction that failed. Invoking this instruction is not supported in Palm OS applications.

ID=kStr_ErrPrivilegeViolation
ENGLISH=%App just executed opcode %ins, a privileged machine language instruction.\n\nA “privileged machine language instruction” is one reserved for use by the operating system. Invoking such instructions is not supported in Palm OS applications.

ID=kStr_ErrTrace
ENGLISH=%App just executed an instruction with the CPU’s “trace” mode enabled. Normally, this mode is enabled by a debugger for the purpose of single-stepping through an application. However, no debugger is currently connected to handle trace mode.

ID=kStr_ErrATrap
ENGLISH=%App just executed an illegal or unknown machine language instruction. The opcode executed was %ins.

ID=kStr_ErrFTrap
ENGLISH=%App just executed an illegal or unknown machine language instruction. The opcode executed was %ins.

ID=kStr_ErrTRAPx
ENGLISH=%App just executed a “TRAP #%num” machine language instruction. Invoking such instructions is not supported in Palm OS applications.


// Special cases to hardware exceptions

ID=kStr_ErrStorageHeap
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the storage heap. In order to protect the integrity of the user’s data, such direct access is not allowed. Instead, applications should use special Palm OS functions for this purpose.

ID=kStr_ErrNoDrawWindow
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem. This access usually indicates that the application is calling a Window Manager function without first establishing a valid DrawWindow.

ID=kStr_ErrNoGlobals
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem. This access usually means that the application accessed a global variable after PilotMain was called with a launch code that does not support globals. The last launch code sent to the application was “%launch_code”.

ID=kStr_ErrSANE
ENGLISH=%App just performed a floating point operation using a calling sequence specific to the Mac OS. This indicates that the application was compiled with the incorrect Floating Point option in the development environment that created it.

ID=kStr_ErrTRAP0
ENGLISH=%App just executed a “TRAP #0” machine language instruction. This instruction is often used by debuggers to set breakpoints. However, no debugger is currently connected to handle the breakpoint.

ID=kStr_ErrTRAP8
ENGLISH=%App just executed a “TRAP #8” machine language instruction. This instruction is generated when calling the DbgBreak function as a method for breaking into an external debugger. However, no debugger is currently connected.


// Fatal Poser-detected errors

ID=kStr_ErrStackOverflow
ENGLISH=%App has overflowed the stack. The functions currently using the stack are: %sc.

ID=kStr_ErrUnimplementedTrap
ENGLISH=%App called Palm OS routine #%trap_num (%trap_name). This routine does not exist in this version of the Palm OS.

ID=kStr_ErrInvalidRefNum
ENGLISH=%App called a function in a shared library using a reference number of %ref_num. This reference number does not correspond to any currently installed library and is invalid.

ID=kStr_ErrCorruptedHeap
ENGLISH=During a regular checkup, Palm OS Emulator determined that the dynamic heap chunk with header address %mem got corrupted. %corruption_type.

ID=kStr_ErrInvalidPC1
ENGLISH=%App just changed the emulated program counter to %mem. This address is invalid because %reason.

ID=kStr_ErrInvalidPC2
ENGLISH=%App just changed the emulated program counter to %mem. This address is invalid because %reason. The program counter was changed when %when.


// Non-fatal Poser-detected errors

ID=kStr_ErrLowMemory
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in low memory.\n\n“Low memory” is defined as the first 256 bytes of memory. It should not be directly accessed by applications under any circumstances.

ID=kStr_ErrSystemGlobals
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the Palm OS global variables.\n\n“Palm OS global variables” are memory locations reserved for the private use of the Palm OS. They should not be directly accessed by applications under any circumstances.

ID=kStr_ErrScreen
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in screen memory.\n\n“Screen memory” is the area of RAM containing the pixels appearing on the LCD display. It should not be directly accessed by applications under any circumstances. Instead, they should use the Window Manager functions for altering the contents of the display.

ID=kStr_ErrHardwareRegisters
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the memory-mapped hardware registers.\n\n“Memory-mapped hardware registers” are memory locations that control the operation of your handheld device’s hardware. They should not be directly accessed by applications under any circumstances.

ID=kStr_ErrROM
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the ROM.\n\nSuch an access has no effect, and usually indicates an error in the application.

ID=kStr_ErrMemMgrStructures
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in Memory Manager data structures.\n\nThese data structures include things like the headers preceding each block in a heap, as well as the heap header itself. Such an access usually means that an application allocated a buffer (possibly with MemPtrNew) that wasn’t large enough for its purpose. When the application then tries to write data to the buffer, it writes off the end of the buffer, accessing the start of the buffer following it in memory.

ID=kStr_ErrMemMgrSemaphore
ENGLISH=The Memory Manager semaphore has been held for longer than 1 minute. Palm recommends that applications not acquire the Memory Manager semaphore at all, but that if they do, they should not hold the semaphore any longer than that.

ID=kStr_ErrFreeChunk
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in an unallocated chunk of memory.\n\nAn “unallocated chunk of memory” is a chunk of memory that has not been reserved for use by the application through calling MemPtrNew or MemHandleNew. It should not be accessed by applications under any circumstances. Such an access usually means that an application is accessing a chunk that used to be allocated to the application but has since been returned with MemPtrFree or MemHandleFree.

ID=kStr_ErrUnlockedChunk
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in an unlocked chunk of memory.\n\nAn “unlocked chunk of memory” is one that has been allocated with MemHandleNew but that has not been locked with MemHandleLock. Such an access usually means that an application allocated a buffer with MemHandleNew, locked it with MemHandleLock, unlocked it with MemHandleUnlock, and then used the pointer that was returned by MemHandleLock.

ID=kStr_ErrLowStack
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the unused portion of the stack. The stack range is %stack_low - %stack_high, and the stack pointer is %stack_pointer.\n\nThe “stack” is the area of RAM used to contain function parameters and local variables. The used portion of the stack is indicated by the stack pointer. Applications may access the area of the stack above the stack pointer, but not below it.

ID=kStr_ErrStackFull
ENGLISH=%App is close to overflowing the stack. The functions currently using the stack are: %sc.

ID=kStr_ErrSizelessObject
ENGLISH=Form object ID #%obj_id (left = %left, top = %top, right = %right, bottom = %bottom) from %app has a height or width of zero. Applications should hide objects by calling FrmHideObject instead of setting their dimensions to zero.\n\nAnother way to get this error message is to call FrmCopyTitle or FrmCopyLabel to change a title or label to a string larger than what was specified in the form resource. Doing this often corrupts other objects on the form.

ID=kStr_ErrOffscreenObject
ENGLISH=Form object ID #%obj_id (left = %left, top = %top, right = %right, bottom = %bottom) from %app is completely offscreen. Applications should hide objects by calling FrmHideObject instead of placing them completely offscreen.\n\nAnother way to get this error message is to call FrmCopyTitle or FrmCopyLabel to change a title or label to a string larger than what was specified in the form resource. Doing this often corrupts other objects on the form.

ID=kStr_ErrFormAccess
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the “%field” field of the form starting at %form.\n\nThe data at this memory location is owned by the Form Manager. Applications should not access the data directly. Instead, they should make the appropriate Form Manager calls.

ID=kStr_ErrFormObjectListAccess
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the “%field” field of the form object list entry with index #%index, which belongs to the form starting at %form.\n\nThe data at this memory location is owned by the Form Manager. Applications should not access the data directly. Instead, they should make the appropriate Form Manager calls.

ID=kStr_ErrFormObjectAccess
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the “%field” field of the %type starting at %object, which belongs to the form starting at %form.\n\nThe data at this memory location is owned by the Form Manager. Applications should not access the data directly. Instead, they should make the appropriate Form Manager calls.

ID=kStr_ErrWindowAccess
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the “%field” field of the window starting at %window.\n\nThe data at this memory location is owned by the Window Manager. Applications should not access the data directly. Instead, they should make the appropriate Window Manager calls.

ID=kStr_ErrBitmapAccess
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the “%field” field of the bitmap starting at %bitmap.\n\nThe data at this memory location is owned by the Palm OS. Applications should not access the data directly. Instead, they should make the appropriate Palm OS calls.

ID=kStr_ErrProscribedFunction
ENGLISH=%App just called Palm OS routine “%function_name”.\n\nApplications should not call this function because %reason.

ID=kStr_ErrStepSpy
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, changing it from %old_value to %new_value.

ID=kStr_ErrWatchpoint
ENGLISH=%App just %op memory location %mem, which is in the range from %watch_start to %watch_end specified in the Breakpoint dialog box.

ID=kStr_ErrMemoryLeak
ENGLISH=Found %num_leaks memory leak for %app. Information concerning the leak can be found in the log file.

ID=kStr_ErrMemoryLeaks
ENGLISH=Found %num_leaks memory leaks for %app. Information concerning the leaks can be found in the log file.


// Palm OS-detected errors

ID=kStr_ErrSysFatalAlert
ENGLISH=%App called SysFatalAlert with the message: “%message”.

ID=kStr_ErrDbgMessage
ENGLISH=%App called DbgMessage with the message: “%message”.


// Other errors

ID=kStr_BadChecksum
ENGLISH=The ROM you’ve chosen has an invalid checksum.\n
	\n
	The most common reason for an invalid checksum has been from the use of 
	utility programs that modify the contents of the ROM without also updating 
	its internal checksum.\n
	\n
	Palm, Inc. does not support the use of this ROM. Use it with caution.

ID=kStr_UnknownDeviceWarning
ENGLISH=Unable to determine an appropriate device to emulate for this ROM file.\n
	\n
	Palm, Inc. does not support the use of this ROM. Use it with caution, 
	as the operation of a ROM with an incorrect device emulation will certainly 
	cause the ROM to crash, and may crash the Palm OS Emulator.

ID=kStr_UnknownDeviceError
ENGLISH=This ROM is for a device not supported by this version of the emulator.\n
	\n
	Palm, Inc. does not support the use of this ROM.

ID=kStr_MissingSkins
ENGLISH=Palm OS Emulator needs “skin” files in order to correctly 
	display the hardware devices it emulates. The Emulator looks 
	for these skins in a directory called “Skins”. However, 
	that directory was not found.\n
	\n
	Previous versions of the Emulator would look for any directory 
	starting with the word “Skins” and search that directory for 
	skin files. With the current Emulator, the directory must be 
	named exactly “Skins”.\n
	\n
	If you don’t have any skin files at all, you can download them 
	from the Emulator download Web page:\n
	\n
	     <http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools/emulator>\n
	\n
	Follow the instructions included with that archive for installing 
	the files.

ID=kStr_InconsistentDatabaseDates
ENGLISH=The creation date (%cr_date) in the database header inside “%database_name” is 
	more recent than the modification date (%mod_date).\n
	\n
	The Emulator does not consider this to be a problem, and neither does the Palm 
	OS. However, some versions of HotSync will test for this condition and report 
	an error, so you may wish to fix the database before trying to install it on a 
	device.

ID=kStr_NULLDatabaseDate
ENGLISH=The creation date in the database header inside “%database_name” is zero.\n
	\n
	The Emulator does not consider this to be a problem, and neither does the Palm 
	OS. However, some versions of HotSync will test for this condition and report 
	an error, so you may wish to fix the database before trying to install it on a 
	device.

ID=kStr_NeedHostFS
ENGLISH=In order to make use of the information specified in this dialog, 
	you need to have installed HostFS.prc. You can download this file from 
	the Palm OS Emulator download Web page:\n
	\n
	     <http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools/emulator/>

ID=kStr_InvalidAddressNotEven
ENGLISH=The address "%s" is invalid because it is not even.

ID=kStr_InvalidAddressNotInROMOrRAM
ENGLISH=The address "%s" is invalid because it is not in ROM or RAM.

ID=kStr_CannotParseCondition
ENGLISH=Can't parse the condition "%s".

ID=kStr_UserNameTooLong
ENGLISH=The name entered into the HotSync User Name field is too long. It needs 
	to be 40 characters or less.
